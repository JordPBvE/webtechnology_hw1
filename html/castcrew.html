        <span class="ccdescription">Wesley Wales Anderson (born May 1, 1969) is an American filmmaker.
            His films are known for their eccentricity and unique visual and narrative styles. They often contain themes of grief, 
            loss of innocence, and dysfunctional families. Cited by some critics as a modern-day example of the work of an auteur,
            three of Anderson's films have appeared in BBC Culture's 2016 poll of the greatest films since 2000.</span>
